# ðŸŒ¾ NutriQuest - A Food Nutrition Education Game

**Supporting UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger**

NutriQuest is an interactive educational game designed to teach children (ages 7-12) about proper nutrition and food security through gamified learning experiences. Built with Scala and ScalaFX, the game features two distinct modes representing Malaysian rural and urban contexts.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of PRG2104: Object-Oriented Programming course, demonstrating key OOP concepts including:
- **Abstraction** - Simplified interfaces hiding complex implementations
- **Inheritance** - Specialized character classes extending base abstractions  
- **Polymorphism** - Multiple forms of behavior based on context
- **Encapsulation** - Protected data with controlled access
- **MVC Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns

##Features

### Game Modes
- **Village Mode** (120 seconds) - Focus on rural nutrition challenges and local food sources
- **Urban Mode** (60 seconds) - Emphasis on city lifestyle nutrition needs
